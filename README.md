# Medical Appointments No-Show Analysis

A data science project analyzing factors that influence patient attendance at medical appointments. This analysis aims to help healthcare providers better understand and reduce appointment no-shows, ultimately improving healthcare delivery efficiency and patient outcomes.

## Project Overview

Medical appointment no-shows significantly impact healthcare systems, leading to reduced efficiency and increased costs. This project analyzes a dataset of medical appointments to understand patterns in patient attendance and identify factors that might influence no-show rates. Our analysis examines patient demographics, appointment scheduling patterns, and the effectiveness of SMS reminders.

## Data Description

The dataset contains medical appointment records with the following key features:

- Patient demographics (age, gender)
- Health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, disabilities)
- Appointment details (scheduled date, appointment date)
- Social factors (scholarship status, SMS reminder receipt)
- Attendance outcome (show/no-show)

## Data Preparation

Our analysis implements several crucial data cleaning steps:

1. Date Handling
   - Conversion of appointment dates to datetime format
   - Calculation of waiting time between scheduling and appointment

2. Data Type Optimization
   - Converting binary indicators to boolean type
   - Proper categorization of gender and other categorical variables
   - Standardization of disability indicators

3. Data Quality Improvements
   - Removal of invalid age entries
   - Elimination of redundant identifier columns
   - Handling of inconsistent categorical values

## Key Findings

Our analysis revealed several important insights about medical appointment attendance:

1. Gender Patterns
   - Female patients show higher attendance rates
   - Gender differences remain consistent across age groups

2. Appointment Timing
   - Shorter waiting periods correlate with better attendance
   - Optimal scheduling window identified for maximum attendance

3. Communication Impact
   - SMS reminders show modest positive effect on attendance
   - Effectiveness varies across different patient demographics

4. Health Status Influence
   - Chronic conditions show minimal correlation with attendance
   - No significant impact of scholarship status on show-up rates

## Visualizations

The project includes several informative visualizations:

1. Attendance Distribution
   - Gender-based attendance patterns
   - Impact of SMS reminders
   - Waiting time analysis

2. Health Factors
   - Correlation matrix of chronic conditions
   - Scholarship influence on attendance
   - Age distribution analysis

## Ethical Considerations

This project handles sensitive healthcare data and follows these principles:

1. Privacy Protection
   - Removal of personal identifiers
   - Aggregated analysis to prevent individual identification
   - Secure data handling practices

2. Bias Mitigation
   - Careful consideration of demographic factors
   - Awareness of social determinants of health
   - Balanced interpretation of results

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for project expansion include:

1. Advanced Analytics
   - Predictive modeling for no-show risk
   - Time series analysis of attendance patterns
   - Machine learning for patient categorization

2. Additional Features
   - Weather impact analysis
   - Transportation accessibility factors
   - Economic indicators influence

3. System Integration
   - Real-time prediction capabilities
   - Integration with appointment systems
   - Automated reminder optimization
